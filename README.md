# Jweb
A jakarta web app that I built for a school project  it provides role Based auth(administrator/client) implemented with session storage , password hashing ,
Ip logging for users , users management , Statistics with Chart.js , managing rooms and their occupation for diifrent client (each client can managage his own rentals as long as they were not validated by an admin beforehand).

  If the application is still hosted the link is  https://occupation.herokuapp.com/ and login info are admin/admin for admin login , or test/test for client login
 
 The front end is based on the Corona Admin free bootstrap template  https://github.com/BootstrapDash/corona-free-dark-bootstrap-admin-template which has an MIT license
